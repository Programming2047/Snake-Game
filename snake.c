/*
 *	a possible implementation of a snake as a linked list
 *	basic list functions 
 *
 *	snake works as a pointer to the whole structure, while segment represents a single tile,
 *	the (x, y) of each segment on the board, with a pointer(connection) to the next one
 *
 *	when i move the snake, instead of redoing the whole structure i simply add a new segment in the next position
 *	and delete the last segment, when the snake eats i just add the segment without removing anything
 *
 *	to check for intersections with itself i just check if the head(x,y) intersects with any segment, might work
 *	in the same way with the board
